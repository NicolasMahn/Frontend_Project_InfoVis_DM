                <p>
                    This project focuses on analyzing GASTech employee data related to vehicle tracking, credit card, and loyalty card transactions. 
                    The primary objective is to assist law enforcement in identifying suspicious patterns in employee behavior preceding their disappearance. 
                    By utilizing visual analytics, the investigation explores interactions between these data sources, uncovering hidden relationships, anomalies, and suspicious activities.
